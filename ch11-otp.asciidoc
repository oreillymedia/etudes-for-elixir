[[OTP]]
Getting Started with OTP
------------------------

In order to help me understand how the +GenServer+ behavior works,
I drew the diagram shown in <<FIG1101>>.

[[FIG1101]]
.Processing a call in +GenServerr+ 
image::images/eter_1101.png[float="true"]

The client does a +GenServer.call(server, request)+. The server will
then call the +handle_call/3+ function that you have provided in the
+Module+ that you told +GenServerr+ to use. +GenServer+ will send your
module the client's +request+, an identifier telling who the request is
+from+, and the server's current +state+.

Your +handle_call/3+ function will fulfill the client's +request+ and
send a +{:reply, reply, new_state}+ tuple back to the server.
It, in turn, will send the +reply+ back to the client, and use the
+new_state+ to update its state.

In _Introducing Elixir_ and in the next two études,
the client is you, using the shell. The module that handles the
client's call is contained within the same module as the +GenServer+
framework, but, as the preceding diagram shows, it does not have to be.

Étude 11-1: Get the Weather
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this étude, you will create a weather server using the +GenServer+
OTP behavior.This server will handle requests using a four-letter 
weather station identifier and will return a brief summary of the
weather. You may also ask the server for a list of most recently
accessed weather stations. The name of your module will be +Weather+.

Here is some sample output, with lines reformatted for ease of reading.

Obtaining Weather Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To retrieve a web page, you must first call Erlang's
+:inets.start/0+; you will
want to do this in your +init/1+ code. Then, simply call
+:httpc.request(_url_)+, where +_url_+ is a string containing the URL
you want. In this case, you will use the
server provided by http://www.noaa.gov/[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]. This server accepts four-letter
weather station codes and returns an
XML file summarizing the current weather at that station. You request
this data with a URL in the form

+http://w1.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/_NNNN_.xml+

where +_NNNN_+ is the station code.Since this is an Erlang function,
you must use a character list enclosed in single quotes instead of an
Elixir binary string in double quotes.

If the call to +:httpc.request/1+ fails, you
will get a tuple of the form +{:error,_information_}+.

If it succeeds, you will get a tuple in the form:

[subs="quotes"]
----
{ok,{{'HTTP/1.1',_code_,'_code message_'},
     [{'_HTTP header attribute_','_value_'},
      {'_Another attribute_','_another value_'}],
     '_page contents_'}}
----

where +_code_+ is the return code (200 means the page was found,
404 means it's missing, anything else is some sort of error).

So, let's say you have successfully retrieved a station's data. You will
then get page content that contains something like this.

This result will be an Erlang character list, so you should use
+list_to_binary+ to convert it to an Elixir string.

Parsing the Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While it is possible to use Erlang's +xmerl_scan+ module or the 
+erlsom+ module (http://erlsom.sourceforge.net/erlsom.htm)
to parse arbitrary XML data, the XML returned from the server is
sufficiently simple (and sanely formatted) that you can use
regular expressions to parse the data. The following code will
give you the content of an XML element with the specified name, or
+nil+ if there is no such element. It works by dynamically constructing
a pattern that looks for the opening and closing tags of the
element name. The part of the pattern in parentheses means "one or
more of any character that is not a less than sign"; because it is
in parentheses, +Regex.run+ will return the matched portion as the
second item in a list. (The first item is the part of the XML
string matched by the entire pattern.)

// [source,elixir]
----
defp get_content(element_name, xml) do
  {_, pattern} = Regex.compile(
    "<#{element_name}>([^<]+)</#{atom_to_binary(element_name)}>")
  result = Regex.run(pattern, xml)
  case result do
    [_all, match] -> {element_name, match}
    nil -> {element_name, nil}
  end
end
----

Set up a Supervisor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The way I constructed the URL (using +<>+ instead of interpolation)
allows you to easily crash the server by handing it a number instead
of a string for the station code.  Set up a supervisor to restart the
server when it crashes. In the following output, the +Process.unlink+ call ensures that the shell, which is also a supervisor, does not kill any errant processes.

Étude 11-2: Wrapper Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the previous étude, you made calls directly to +gen_server+. This is
great for experimentation, but in a real application, you do not want
other modules to have to know the exact format of the arguments you gave
to +gen_server:call/2+ or +gen_server:cast/2+. Instead, you provide a
"wrapper" function that makes the actual call. In this way, you can change
the internal format of your server requests while the interface you present
to other users remains unchanged.

In this étude, then, you will provide two wrapper functions
+report/1+ and +recent/0+. The +report/1+ function will take a station name
as its argument and do the appropriate +gen_server:call+; the
+recent/0+ function will do an appropriate +gen_server:cast+. Everything
else in your code will remain unchanged. You will, of course, have to add
+report/1+ and +recent/0+ to the +-export+ list.

Here's some sample output.

[[CH11-ET03]]
Étude 11-3: Independent Server and Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the previous études, the client and server have been running in
the same shell. In this étude, you will make the server available to
clients running in other shells.

To make a node available to other nodes, you need to name the node by using
the +--name+ option when starting +iex+. It looks like this:

// [source,iex]
----
michele@localhost $ iex --name serverNode
Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (0.8.3.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(serverNode@localhost.gateway.2wire.net)1> 
----

This is a _long name_. You can also set up a node with a short name by using
the +--sname+ option:

// [source,iex]
----
michele@localhost $  iex --sname serverNode
Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (0.8.3.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(serverNode@localhost)1> 
----

WARNING: If you set up a node in this way, _any_ other node can connect
to it and do any shell commands at all. In order to prevent this,
you may use the +-setcookie _Cookie_+ when starting +erl+. Then,
only nodes that have the same _Cookie_ (which is an atom) can
connect to your node.

To connect to a node, use the +:net_adm.ping/1+ function, and give it
the name of the server (as an atom) that you want to connect to as its
argument. If you connect succesfully, the function will return the atom
+:pong+; otherwise, it will return +:pang+.

Here is an example. First, start a shell with a (very bad) secret
cookie:

// [source,iex]
----
michele@localhost $ iex --sname serverNode --cookie chocolateChip
Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (0.8.3.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(serverNode@localhost)1> 
----

Now, open another terminal window, start a shell with a different
cookie, and try to connect to the server node. I have purposely used
a different user name to show that this works too.

// [source,iex]
----
[steve@localhost ~]$ iex --sname clientNode --cookie oatmealRaisin
Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (0.8.3.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(clientNode@localhost)1> :net_adm.ping(:serverNode@localhost)
:pang
----

The server node will detect this attempt and let you know about it:

// [source,iex]
----
=ERROR REPORT==== 12-May-2013::18:08:10 ===
** Connection attempt from disallowed node clientNode@localhost ** 
----

Quit the client shell, and restart it with a matching cookie, and
all will be well.

// [source,iex]
----
[steve@localhost ~]$ iex --sname clientNode --cookie chocolateChip
Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (0.8.3.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(clientNode@localhost)1> :net_adm.ping(:serverNode@localhost)
:pong
----

To make your weather report server available to other nodes, you
need to do these things:

* In the +start_link/0+ convenience method, set the first argument to
+gen_server:start_link/4+ to +{:global, __MODULE__}+ instead of
+{:local, __MODULE__}+
* In calls to +gen_server:call/2+ and +gen_server:cast/2+, replace the
module name +Weather+ with +{:global, __MODULE__}+
* Add a +connect/1+ function that takes the server node name as its
argument. This function will use +net_adm:ping/1+ to attempt to contact
the server. It provides appropriate feedback when it succeeds or fails.

Here is what it looks like when one user starts the server in a shell.

// [source,iex]
----
michele@localhost $ iex --sname serverNode --cookie meteorology
Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (0.8.3.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(serverNode@localhost)1> Weather.start_link
{:ok,#PID<0.45.0>}
----

And here's another user in a different shell, calling upon the server.

// [source,iex]
----
steve@localhost $ iex --sname clientNode --cookie meteorology
Erlang R16B (erts-5.10.1) [source] [smp:2:2] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false]

Interactive Elixir (0.8.3.dev) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(clientNode@localhost)1> Weather.connect(:serverNode@localhost)
Connected to server.
:ok
iex(clientNode@localhost)2> Weather.report("KSJC")
{:ok,[location: "San Jose International Airport, CA", observation_time_rfc822: "Sun, 12 May 2013 18:53:00 -0700", weather: "Fair", temperature_string: "71.0 F (21.7 C)"]}
iex(clientNode@localhost)3> Weather.report("KITH")
{:ok,[location: "Ithaca / Tompkins County, NY", observation_time_rfc822: "Sun, 12 May 2013 21:56:00 -0400", weather: "Mostly Cloudy", temperature_string: "41.0 F (5.0 C)"]}
iex(clientNode@localhost)4> Weather.recent()
:ok
----

Whoa! What happened to the output from that last call?
The problem is that the +Weather.recent/0+ call does
an +IO.puts/1+ call; that output will go to the server shell, since the
server is running that code, not the client.
You could fix this
problem by changing +Weather.recent/0+ from using
+:gen_server.cast/2+ to use +:gen_server.call/2+ instead to return
the recently reported weather stations as its reply. This would also require a new clause for +Weather.handle_call/3+.

There's one more question that went through my mind after I implemented
my solution: how did I know that the client was calling the +Weather+ 
code that was running on the server and not the +Weather+ code in
its own shell? It was easy to find out: I stopped the server.

// [source,iex]
----
iex(serverNode@localhost)2> 
User switch command
 --> q
michele@localhost $ 
----

Then I had the client try to get a weather report.

// [source,iex]
----
iex(clientNode@localhost)5> Weather.report("KGAI")
** (exit) {:noproc,{:gen_server,:call,[{:global,Weather},"KGAI"]}}
    gen_server.erl:180: :gen_server.call/2
    erl_eval.erl:569: :erl_eval.do_apply/6

    /bin/elixir/lib/iex/lib/iex/server.ex:19:
    IEx.Server.do_loop/1
----

The fact that it failed told me that yes, indeed, the client was
getting its information from the server.

<<SOLUTION11-ET03,See a suggested solution in Appendix A.>>

[[CH11-ET04]]
Étude 11-4: Chat Room
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the previous études, the client simply made a call to the server, and
didn't do any processing of its own. In this étude, you will create a
"chat room" with a chat server and multiple clients, much as you see in
<<FIG1102>>.

[[FIG1102]]
.Server with multiple clients
image:images/eter_1102.png[float="true"]

The interesting part of this program is that the client will _also_ be
a +gen_server+, as shown in <<FIG1103>>.

[[FIG1103]]
.Client as a +gen_server+
image:images/eter_1103.png[float="true"]

Up until now, you have been using a module name as the first argument to
+gen_server:call/2+, and in the previous étude, you used
+net_adm:ping/1+ to connect to a server.

In this étude, you won't need +net_adm:ping/1+. Instead,
you will use a tuple of the form
+{Module, Node}+ to directly connect to the node you want. So, for
example, if you want to make a call to a module named +chatroom+ on
a node named +lobby@localhost+, you would do something like this:

+gen_server:call({chatroom, lobby@localhost}, Request)+

This means
you won't need to connect with +net_adm:ping/1+. 

Here is my design for the solution. You, of course, may come up
with an entirely different and better design.

My solution has two modules, both of which use the +gen_server+ behavior.

The +chatroom+ Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The first module, +chatroom+, will keep as its state a list of tuples, one
tuple for each person in the chat. Each tuple has the format
+{{UserName, UserServer}, Pid}+. The Pid is the one that +gen_server:call+
receives in the +From+ parameter; it's guaranteed to be unique for each
person in chat.

The +handle_call/3+ function will accept the following requests.

+{login, UserName, ServerName}+::
Adds the user name, server name, and Pid (which is in the +From+ parameter)
to the server's state. Don't allow a duplicate user name from the same server.

+logout+::
Removes the user from the state list.

+{say, Text}+::
Sends the given Text to all the other users in the chat room. Use
+gen_server:cast/2+ to send the message.

+users+::
Returns the list of names and servers for all people currently in the
chat room.

+{who, Person, ServerName}+::
Return the profile of the given person/server. (This is "extra credit";
see the following details about the +person+ module). It works by
calling the +person+ module at +ServerName+ and giving it a
+get_profile+ request.

The +person+ Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The other module, +person+, has a +start_link/1+ function; the argument
is the node name of the chat room server. This will be passed on to the
+init/1+ function. This is stored in the server's state. I did this because
many other calls need to know the chat room server's name, and keeping it in the
person's state seemed a reasonable choice.

For extra credit, the state will also include the person's profile, which
is a list of +{Key, Value}+ tuples.

The +handle_call/3+ takes care of these requests:

+get_chat_node+::
Returns the chat node name that's stored in the server's state. (Almost all of
the wrapper functions to be described in the following section will need
the chat node name.)

+get_profile+::
Returns the profile that's stored in the server's state (extra credit)

+{profile, Key, Value}+::
If the profile already contains the key, replace it with the given value.
Otherwise, add the key and value to the profile. Hint: use 
+lists:keymember/3+ and +lists:keyreplace/4+. (extra credit)

Because the chat room server uses +gen_server:cast/2+ to send messages
to the people in the room, your +handle_cast/3+ function will receive messages sent from other users in this form:

+{message, {FromUser, FromServer}, Text}+

Wrapper Functions for the +person+ module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

+get_chat_node()+::
A convenience function to get the name of the chat host node by doing
+gen_server:call(person, get_chat_node)+

+login(UserName)+::
Calls the chat room server with a {login, UserName} request. If the
user name is an atom, use +atom_to_list/1+ to convert it to a string.

+logout()+::
Calls the chat room server with a +logout+ request. As you saw in the
description of +chatroom+, the server uses the process ID to figure out
who should be logged out.

+say(Text)+::
Calls the chat server with a +{say, Text}+ request.

+users()+::
Calls the chat server with a +users+ request.

+who(UserName, UserNode)+::
Calls the chat server with a +{who, UserName, UserNode}+ request to
see the profile of the given person. (extra credit)

+profile(Key, Value)+::
A convenience method that calls the +person+ module with a
+{profile, Key, Value}+ request. (extra credit)

Putting it All Together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here is what the chat room server looks like. The lines beginning with
+Recipient list:+ are debug output. I have gotten rid of the startup lines
from the +erl+ command.

// [source,iex]
-------
erl -sname lobby

(lobby@localhost)1> chatroom:start_link().
