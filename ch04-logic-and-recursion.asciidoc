NOTE: You can learn more about working with logical flow and recursion in Chapter 3 of _Erlang Programming_, Chapter 3 of _Programming Erlang_, Sections 2.6 and 2.15 of _Erlang and OTP in Action_, and Chapters 3 and 5 of _Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good!_.

Étude 4-1: Using +case+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Change the +area/3+ function that you wrote in
<<CH03-ET02,Étude 3-2>> so that it uses a +case+ instead
of pattern matching. Use a guard on the function definition to ensure
that the numeric arguments are both greater than zero.

Étude 4-2: Recursion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a typical exercise for recursion: finding the greatest common
divisor (GCD) of two integers. Instead of giving Euclid's method, we'll
do this with a method devised by Edsger W. Dijkstra. The neat part about
Dijkstra's method is that you don't need to do any division to find
the result.  Here is the method.

To find the GCD of integers M and N:

* If M and N are equal, the result is M.
* If M is greater than N, the result is the GCD of M - N and N
* Otherwise M must be less than N, and the result is the GCD of M and N - M.

Write a function +gcd/2+ in a module named +Dijkstra+ that implements
the algorithm. This program is an ideal place to use Elixir's +cond+ construct. 
Here is some sample output.

// [source,iex]
----
iex(1)> c("dijkstra.ex")
[Dijkstra]
iex(2)> Dijkstra.gcd(2,8)
2
iex(3)> Dijkstra.gcd(14, 21)

iex(5)> Dijkstra.gcd(120, 36)
12

The next two exercises involve writing code to raise a number to an integer
power (like 2.5^3^ or 4^-2^) and finding the __n__th root of a number, such
as the cube root of 1728 or the fifth root of 3.2. 

These capabilities already exist with the +:math.pow/2+ function, so you may
wonder why I'm asking you to re-invent the wheel. The reason is not to replace
+:math.pow/2+, but to experiment with recursion by writing functions that can be
expressed quite nicely that way.

Étude 4-3: Non-Tail Recursive Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create a module named +Powers+ (no relation to Francis Gary Powers), and
write a function named +take/2+ which takes parameters +x+  and +x+ and
returns the value of _x_^_n_^.

Here's the information you need to know to write the function:

* Any number to the power 0 equals 1.
* Any number to the power 1 is that number itself -- that stops the
  recursion.
* When +n+ is positive, +x^n^+ is equal to +x+ times +x^(n - 1)^+ -- 
  there's your recursion.
* When +n+ is negative, +x^n^+ is equal to +1.0 / x^-n^+

Note that this algorithm is _not_ tail recursive.  Here is some sample output.

Étude 4-4: Tail Recursion with an Accumulator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Practice the "accumulator trick." 
Rewrite the +raise/2+ function for +N+ greater than zero so that it
calls a helper function +raise/3+  This new function has +X+, +N+, and
an +Accumulator+ as its parameters.

Your +raise/2+ function will return 1 when +N+ is equal to 0,
and will return +1.0 / raise(X, -N)+ when N is less than zero.

When +N+ is greater than zero, +raise/2+ will
call +raise/3+ with arguments +X+, +N+, and 1 as the Accumulator.

The +raise/3+ function will return the
+Accumulator+ when +N+ equals 0 (this will stop the recursion).

Otherwise, recursively call +raise/3+ with +X+, +N - 1+,
and +X+ times the +Accumulator+ as its arguments.

The +raise/3+ function _is_ tail recursive.

[[CH04-ET05]]
Étude 4-5: Recursion with a Helper Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this exercise, you will add a function +nth_root/2+ to the
+powers+ module. This new function finds the
__n__th root of a number, where _n_ is an integer.
For example, +nth_root(36, 2)+ will calculate
the square root of 36, and +nth_root(1.728, 3)+ will return the cube
root of 1.728.

The algorithm used here is the Newton-Raphson method for calculating
roots. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method for details).

You will need a helper function +nth_root/3+, whose parameters
are +X+, +N+, and an approximation to the result, which we
will call +A+. +nth_root/3+ works as follows:

* Calculate +F+ as +(A^N^ - X)+
* Calculate +Fprime+ as +N * A^(N - 1)^+
* Calculate your next approximation (call it +Next+) as +A - F / Fprime+
* Calculate the change in value (call it +Change+) as the absolute value of +Next - A+
* If the +Change+ is
less than some limit (say, 1.0e-8), stop the recursion and return
+Next+; that's as close to the root as you are going to get.
* Otherwise, call the +nth_root/3+ function again with
+X+, +N+, and +Next+ as its arguments.

For your first approximation, use +X / 2.0+. Thus, your +nth_root/2+ function
will simply be this:

+nth_root(X, N) -> nth_root(X, N, X / 2.0)+

Use +io:format+ to show each new approximation as you
calculate it. Here is some sample output.
