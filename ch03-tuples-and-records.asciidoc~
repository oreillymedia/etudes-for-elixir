[[ATOMS-TUPLES-PATTERNS]]
Atoms, Tuples, and Pattern Matching
-----------------------------------

NOTE: You can learn more about working with atoms, tuples, and pattern matching in Chapter 2 of _Erlang Programming_, Chapter 2 of _Programming Erlang_, Sections 2.2 and 2.4 of _Erlang and OTP in Action_, and Chapters 1 and 3 of _Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good!_.

Étude 3-1: Pattern Matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Use atoms and pattern matching to make your +area+ function calculate the
area of a rectangle, triangle, or ellipse.  If your parameters are
+Shape+, +A+ and +B+, the area for the atom +rectangle+ is +A * B+,
where +A+ and +B+ represent the length and width. For a +triangle+ atom,
the area is +A * B / 2.0+, with +A+ and +B+ representing
the base and height of the triangle. For an +ellipse+ atom, the area is 
+math:pi() * A * B+, where +A+ and +B+ represent the major and minor radiuses.

Here is some sample output.

Étude 3-2: Guards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Even though you won't get an error message when calculating the area of a shape
that has negative dimensions, it's still worth guarding your +area/3+ function.
You will want two guards for each pattern to make sure that both dimensions
are greater than or equal to zero. Since *both* have to be non-negative, use
commas to separate your guards.

Here is some sample output.

Étude 3-3: Underscores
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you enter a shape that +area/3+ doesn't know about, or if you enter negative
dimensions, Erlang will give you an error message. Use underscores to create a
``catch-all'' version, so that anything at all that doesn't match a valid
rectangle, triangle, or ellipse will return zero. This goes against
the Erlang philosophy of ``let it fail,'' but let's look the other way
and learn about underscores anyway.

Here is some sample output.

[source,erl]
----
1> geom:area(rectangle, 3, 4).
12
2> geom:area(pentagon, 3, 4).
0
3> geom:area(hexagon, -1, 5).
0
4> geom:area(rectangle, 1, -3).
0

Étude 3-4: Tuples as Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Add an +area/1+ function that takes a tuple of the form
+{*shape*,*number*,*number*}+ as its parameter. Export it
instead of +area/3+. The +area/1+ function will call the
private +area/3+ function.

Here is some sample output.

1> c(geom).
{ok,geom}
2> geom:area({rectangle, 7, 3}).

3> geom:area({triangle, 7, 3}).
